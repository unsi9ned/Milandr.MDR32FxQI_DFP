@par Example Description

This example shows how to use EXT_BUS module functions.
That action includes the following steps:
    - EXT_BUS module initialization for used as extern NAND controller;
    - Calculate the NAND Sycles number.


@par Directory contains:

    - main.c             Main program


@par Hardware and Software environment:

    - This example is intended to run on MDR32F1QI eval board with MDR32F1QI microcontroller.
    - HSE oscillator is used so it should be present.


@par How to use.

To launch the example, you must do the following:
    - Create a project and setup all project configurations.
    - Add main.c file.
    - Add the required files from "Libraries" folder:
        MDR32FxQI_config.h
        MDR32FxQI_rst_clk.c
        MDR32FxQI_ext_bus.c
    - Edit the MDR32FxQI_config.h to set appropriate run-time parameter checking level.
    - Compile and link together all .c files and load your image into the target board.
    - Run the example.
